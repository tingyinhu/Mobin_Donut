💡 Challenges 💡
This program moves at a fast pace and covers a large amount of information in a short time. While this can be intense, it also fosters curiosity and encourages independent learning. I found that proactively exploring concepts on my own was key to fully understanding React and applying it effectively.

I initially learned React through online tutorials, which provided a solid foundation and made it easier to follow along during lectures.

To build my understanding, I started with introductory React videos that covered essential topics such as file structure, components, imports/exports, JSX, props, key-value pairs, and state. Once I grasped the fundamentals, I moved on to full project tutorials, which helped me see how everything fits together in a real-world application.

This hands-on approach significantly strengthened my learning and gave me greater confidence in working with React.
